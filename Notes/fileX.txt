Al mio amore:

Moja velka l√°ska,

Today you are becoming 1/4 of a century young. This is probably one of the most important steps of your life and I'm happy to be able to spend it with you. This time I wasn't able to suprise you with any enexpected trip :D 
Actually I wouldn't focus on my present too much (although it's of course the best in the world) but on how lucky you are to be able to spend this day with almost your family and me at the same time. Everyone loves you and want the best for you <3

I can't wait to spend with you more and more time like we did in these two month. It's been a big challenge but we are doing great. What do you think? And what about this summer? How much time would you like to travel with me?
